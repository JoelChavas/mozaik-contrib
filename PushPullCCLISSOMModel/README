The CCLISSOM model architecture translated in the spiking simulation and extended with Push-Pull connectivity
from Jen Kremkow model.

Under heavy constructions.
Missing features:

Realistic lateral arborization extents in L4 and L2/3.
Inclusion of distance-dependent propagation into all connections.
Realistic propagation constants.
Orienataion specific lateral connectivity in L2/3.
Retinotopic LGN-L4 pathway
